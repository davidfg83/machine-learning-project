This repository contains my work for the final project of course 8 of the Coursera/Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. 

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a barbell weightlifting exercise was performed correctly based on a set of predictors that measure weightlifters' movements.
